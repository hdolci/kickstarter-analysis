# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using the provided Kickstarter data, I'll help Louise see how other plays faired in their Kickstarter campaigns. Data will be presented in a tabular format and visualized with charts.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find the success and failure rates of plays Kickstarter campaigns based on the goal amount and time of year when they are launched. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Using Kickstarter data between 2009 - 2017, I was able to use a pivot table to extract the outcome of plays sorted by month in the sheet “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”. By visualizing the data with a line chart, it is very clear that the best time to launch a campaign is during the summer months of May-August with May being the best.

To find out goal amount likely to succeed, I sorted the campaign outcomes for plays by dollar amount ranges on the sheet “Outcomes Based on Goals”. Here we can see campaigns of $1,000 or less the clear favorite at 76% success rate especially when taking into the account the sample size. While there are other goal ranges with more money and closing into the 76% rate of success, their sample size is nowhere as big.

The sample size is one of the challenges here, if we obtained more data, they may be a chance we see a higher goal amount that can achieve success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
As previously mentioned, the summertime especially May is the best time to start a campaign. If the summer months can not be achieved, it is best to launch a campaign anytime but November and December
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As previously mentioned, the highest chance of success are goals under $1,000. If more funding is needed, it would be best to look at $30,000 to $49,000. Given the small sample size, there is reason to believe this may work.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The sample size for larger goal projects
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
For the Outcomes Based on Goal, a stacked bar chart going horizontal would also be visually appealing and easy to understand. For the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date, the regular bar chart would work well by brining areas of high success/failure into focus.
